# JS_Map
This was my first attempt at building an interactive map. I followed ttorials on leaflet and mapbox and learned how to make interactive popups 
I learned how to link leaflet api to use Open Street Map data, how to use x,y coordiantes to make the map and add markers, how to modify the size and appearnace of the map and how to add interactive popoups.
My next steps are to move onto using mapbox for the final map.
